Homework in FP spring course. If it compiles, it works!

## Building

You'll need [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) to build this project.

```bash
stack build --pedantic
```

If you do not have `stack` or do not want to install it, you may use `ghci` and load the tasks there.

```bash
cd src/FP/ 
ghci Task1.hs
```
